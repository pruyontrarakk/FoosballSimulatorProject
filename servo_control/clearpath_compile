1. Download sFoundation libraries on linux.

2. Install the usb driver and give permission for ttyXRUSB0.
$ cd ~/Clearpath/ExarKernelDriver
$ sudo ./Install_DRV_SCRIPT.sh
$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
$ sudo reboot

*** Make sure that the USB of the communication hub is connected to your system using the below command:
$ ls /dev/ttyXRUSB*


3. Build libraries through Makefile.
$ cd ~/Clearpath/sFoundation/sFoundation
$ make
$ sudo ln -s libsFoundation20.so libsFoundation20.so.1

4. Check if the 'libsFoundation20.so' file is created in the ~/Clearpath/sFoundation/sFoundation folder. Then, define the library address for your system to find it.
$ echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/Clearpath/sFoundation/sFoundation' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

5. Go to the directory that includes servo_controller.cpp.
$ cd ~/Clearpath/sFoundation/SDK_Examples/Example-Motion

6. Compile servo_controller.cpp file (Everytime you modify the code, you need to compile.)
$ g++ servo_controller.cpp -o servo_controller -I ~/Clearpath/sFoundation/inc/inc-pub  -L/home/steve/Clearpath/sFoundation/sFoundation -lsFoundation20 -lpthread

6. Execute 
$ servo_controller
